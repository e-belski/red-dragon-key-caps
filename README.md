3D printed key cap customization for the Red Dragon mechanical keyboard.

The motivation for this project comes from the Thingiverse project <url> by <thingiverse user> who 3D printed an entire mechanical keyboard body and soldered the switches and micro controller together. However he used injection molded keys for most of his keyboard. Once I've finalized the keycaps in look and feel on the Red Dragon keyboard, I plan on following <thingiverse user>'s guide and assembling a printed mechanical keyboard from scratch. However instead of using injection modeled caps, I'll use the ones that I develop for this project.

Here's the board I'm using with mechanical switches and backlighting. An added bonus of the switches being backlit is that letters and symbols can be projected through the keycap by creative use of negative space. Additionally this keyboard has the same form factor as <thingiverse user>'s board, so I won't need to create any extra keys.

Here's all of the tools and components that I used in this project.
* Mechanical keyboard
* Monoprice Delta Mini
* Hatchbox PLA Marbled Green Filament

I started with the Cherry MX keycap STL from <url for keycap thingiverse project>. This key however needed some modifications to make it comfortable and natural to type with. I started by dishing out the top surface of the key.

Next I reduced the height of the key so that it is comparable in height to the injection molded keys that came with the Red Dragon keyboard. The piece of the key that connects with the switch comes down further than the stock keys, therefore the overall height of the key needs to be reduced to match the original height of the keyboard.

While adjusting the height, I realized that thickness of the switch connector was rubbing on the sides of the switch. There was a little bit of thickness that could be reduced on the switch mate, therefore I reduced the profile so that it no longer contacts the sides of the switch when a key is depressed.

Then the letter or number of the key needed to be imparted onto the key. Originally I embossed the character onto the surface of the key so that there was a thin section of plastic under the character that allowed the LED to shine through. The emboss also allows the character to be recognizable if the backlights are off.

While experimenting with that, I realized that it might be beneficial to have the letter void embedded in the keycap so that the top and bottom surfaces of the key are smooth.

Still to come are the special keys (shift, ctrl, enter, space, etc.)
